# Multilayer Network Topology Generator (MNTG)

This project is a multilayer network topology generator called MNTG and written in C++.

## Requirements

You will need to have or install all the following packages:

* Igraph 0.7.1
* CppUnit 1.14.0
* CMake 3.2 or newer
* C++14 capable compiler
* Doxygen for docs
* (optional) Graphviz for more graphs in docs
* (optional) PlantUML for more UML diagrams (PlantUML needs Java)

## Building the program

For building the program, just type:

```
make mntg
```

## Installing the program

For installing the program, just type:

```
make install
```

## Usage 

There are several ways to launch the program:

* 1- Run the program with an input file that contains the network topology.


```
./mntg -i Topologies/topo.txt
```

* 2- Run the program with multiple simulation parameters.


```
./mntg -g ER -n 30 -m 0 -p 0.20 -a 2 -f 0.10 -s 3 -r 10
```

* 3- Run the program with multiple simulation parameters and export the network topology generated by the program.


```
./mntg -g BA -n 50 -m 5 -p 1 -a 3 -f 0.20 -s 5 -r 1 -o Topologies/topo.txt
```

The meaning of each program option:

* g : generation method (BA: Barabasi-Albert, ER: Erdos_Renyi)
* n : number of routers of the network (non negative)
* m : number of links for Barabasi-Albert generator (non negative)
* p : connection probability for the graph generator (between 0. and 1.)
* a : number of network layers (non negative)
* f : adaptation function probability for routers (between 0. and 1.)
* s : maximum stack size of protocol layers (non negative)
* r : number of runs (non-zero and non negative)
* i : input file topology (ex:Topologies/topo.txt)
* o : output file topology (ex: Topologies/topo.txt)
* h : help
